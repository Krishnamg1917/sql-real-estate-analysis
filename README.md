# 🏠 Real Estate Market Insights – SQL Case Study  

## 📌 Business Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze **25,000+ residential property sales records** to uncover the **key factors driving property prices**, identify **market trends across time and geography**, and highlight **potential investment opportunities**.

## 🔍 Approach  
Using SQL queries, I explored the dataset to answer critical business questions:  
- What factors (property type, bedrooms, location) influence property pricing?  
- How do average prices evolve over time, and are there seasonal or long-term trends?  
- Which postcodes or neighborhoods consistently show price growth?  
- What is the overall health of the real estate market in terms of volume, price, and growth?  
- Can we identify high-potential areas for investment?
