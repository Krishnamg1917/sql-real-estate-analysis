# 🏠 Real Estate Market Analysis – SQL Case Study  

## 📌 Business Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze residential real estate transactions to uncover the **key factors driving property prices**, identify **market trends across time and geography**, and highlight **potential investment opportunities**. This helps real estate firms, investors, and policymakers understand the dynamics of housing demand and pricing.

## 🔍 Approach  
Using SQL queries, I explored the dataset to answer critical business questions:  
- What factors (property type, bedrooms, location) influence property pricing?  
- How do average prices evolve over time, and are there seasonal or long-term trends?  
- Which postcodes or neighborhoods consistently show price growth?  
- What is the overall health of the real estate market in terms of volume, price, and growth?  
- Can we identify high-potential areas for investment?

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Property Type Impact**: Houses command higher average prices compared to units, with larger bedroom counts leading to significant price increases.  
- **Time Trends**: Average property prices have shown a steady upward trend, with occasional seasonal peaks.  
- **Geographic Differences**: Certain postcodes consistently outperform others, with the **top 6 postcodes by yearly sales volume** capturing the bulk of market activity.  
- **Growth Hotspots**: Postcodes showing consistent year-on-year growth present attractive **investment opportunities**.  
- **Market Health**: The market demonstrates long-term growth, though sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.
